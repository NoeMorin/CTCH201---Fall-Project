# CTCH201---Fall-Project
This is a link to a group project I worked on in the fall of 2020 over a remote-work environment.
This project required my group partner and I to create a display where sound was the main medium. We combined bot hof our ideas into one, and decided to port our ideas over into a VR environment, as we felt it would be the most accessible and easiest to work with over the circumstances of remote delivery of courses in Fall 2020. Jacob, my group partner, did much of the heavy lifting in creating the VR environment and the creation and implementation of the DAW inside of the VR space itself. I was tasked with designing the assets in Maya's 3D creation software, and also to record and ensure the quality of the sounds we used in the mock oceanscape that we chose to go with.
